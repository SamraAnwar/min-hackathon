        <h1>Why Does It <span class="pink ">Work?</span></h1>
        <p>Not all probiotics are the same. The overall biological action of a probiotic is not 
          simply the sum of its individual components actions but the result of a complex 
          network of relationships between the microorganisms it contains and the human 
          host. Unlike many other products on the market, the clinical results obtained 
          from CDS22-formula speak louder than any technical description</p>

       <p> CDS22-formula combines 8 bacterial strains selected for their biochemical and 
        enzymatic profiles and specifically calibrated in precise proportions to 
        synergistically act on the physiology of the human gastrointestinal tract.
        It is crucial to emphasize that the production of the Formulazione De Simone falls 
        within the field of biology, not chemistry, as the bacteria forming the product s 
        base are living organisms. Their cultivation requires advanced scientific 
        knowledge and specific know-how, still protected by industrial secrecy</p>
      
        <p>The unique and advanced know-how developed by Prof. Claudio De Simone, 
      which includes specific industrial secrets, contributes to the uniqueness and 
      efficacy of CDS22-formula, making it extremely difficult for others to replicate or 
      produce an identical or functionally equivalent product.
      Supported by solid scientific evidence, CDS22-formula is highly effective in the 
      dietary management of dysbiosis and other gastrointestinal conditions, offering 
      proven and replicable clinical results</p>

      <h3 class="black">CDS22-formula supports the dietary management of intestinal dysbiosis, contributing to well-being in cases of intestinal
        disorders connected to irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and paucities.</h3>
        <span>Control of intestinal dysbiosis:</span>
        <p>Intestinal dysbiosis is a condition where the natural balance of microorganisms in the intestine is altered, causing various
            gastrointestinal disorders. Controlling dysbiosis is crucial for maintaining digestive health, improving patient comfort, and contributing
            to overall well-being, even in cases of chronic intestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis.</p>
        <span>Immediate and prolonged restoration of intestinal flora:</span>
        <p>CDS22-formula is ideal for both acute and chronic episodes of intestinal dysbiosis. It reduces the severity and duration of symptoms,
            improving patient comfort and accelerating recovery. It is particularly indicated for supporting intestinal health and can be beneficial in
            cases of temporary or chronic intestinal disorders characterized by accelerated transit that prevents normal daily activities or
            adequate night rest.</p>
        <span>Variety of Dosages:</span>
        <p>Available in different formats and dosages to support intestinal health and adapt to individual dietary needs, offering flexibility to
            healthcare professionals in personalizing supplementation.</p>
        <span>Original Formulation:</span>
        <p>CDS22-formula is the original FormulazionDe Simone, a unique combination of proprietary bacterial strains designed to maximize
            intestinal well-being. The strains are cultivated and maintained in proprietary Master Cell Banks, ensuring purity, quality, and
            consistency in every production.</p>
            <span>Guaranteed Safety:</span>
            <p>Every dose has been tested to ensure maximum efficacy and safety. Thanks to a short supply chain approved by the inventor, the
                product maintains the highest quality standards from raw material to packaging.</p>
        <span>Affordability:</span>
        <p>CDS22-formula offers superior value compared to probiotics containing equivalent quantities of bacteria. Efficient production and
            direct cost control allow us to offer a more affordable product on the market.</p>

        <h1><span class="black">De</span><span class="pink">Simone</span><span class="blue">Formulation</span></h1>
        <p>The De Simone Formulation contained in CDS22-formula is the result of pioneering research by Professor Claudio De Simone (MD, FAGA), who redefined
            therapeutic approaches to intestinal health by introducing the use of high concentration probiotic mixtures to dietetically manage acute and chronic
            gastrointestinal disorders.</p>
        <p>His interest in the intestinal microbiota dates back to the 1980s when the importance of the intestinal flora s role was just beginning to be
                understood. Professor De Simone is an honorary member of the American College of Gastroenterology and, after graduating in Medicine and
                Surgery, specialized in gastroenterology, allergology, and clinical immunology. He taught Infectious Diseases at the University of Lâ€™Aquila (Italy).</p>
        <p>He has published over 200 clinical studies, scientific articles, and book chapters.</p>
        <p>Since the commercial launch of his renowned De Simone Formulation in the 1990s, the Professor has actively advocated for better regulation and quality
            control of probiotics, highlighting the potential health and well-being risks.</p>
        <p>As emphasized by Professor De Simone in numerous conferences and publications, many marketed probiotics have not been clinically tested or may not
                correspond to the original clinically tested formulations when marketed, causing substantial differences in the safety and efficacy of the final product (De
                Simone C. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology Vol. 16 No. 9 2018).</p>
        <p>Current regulations often do not require thorough comparative studies to ensure that changes in manufacturing processes do not compromise the efficacy and
            safety of the commercially distributed probiotic product.</p>
            <h1><span class="black">There is ONE </br> De</span><span class="pink">Simone</span><span class="blue">Formulation</span></h1>
        <p>The lack of strict regulation and the possibility for manufacturers to modify formulations without adequately informing consumers pose a threat to public trust.
            In the past, the De Simone Formulation (DSF) was sold under the brand name VSL#3Â®*, by VSL Pharmaceuticals and Actial Srl.</p>
        <p>In 2019, VSL#3Â® distributors were found guilty of false advertising (for more information:Federal Judge Upholds $18M Verdict, Blocks False Advertising of
            VSL#3, Schulman Bhattacharya). Recently, the European Crohn s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) has updated its guidelines to clarify that pre-2016 literature
            references to VSL#3Â® exclusively refer to DSF (ECCO, ECCO News, 2023). In 2024, ESPEN (European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism) published
            the article â€œClarifying Correct Attributions in Scientific Literature: The Case of the De Simone Formulation and VSL#3Â®â€œ, which reiterates the above.</p>
        <p>The De Simone Formulation is sold under the brand name â€œVisbiome  in the USA and Canada (Exegi) and under the brand name De Simone Formulation in
            Korea (HectoHealthcare).</p>
        <p>Soon to be available in the EU under the brand CDS22-formula.</br>*is a registered trademark of VSL Pharmaceuticals and Actial Srl Inc, independent companies from EOS2021 S.r.l.</p>
